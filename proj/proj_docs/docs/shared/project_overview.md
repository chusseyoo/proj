# Project Overview

## QR Code-Based Attendance Management System

This system is built for attendance management where students scan QR codes to mark attendance.

## Important Note

**The system does not generate QR codes.** QR codes are created externally and must contain the student's ID information.

## Purpose

The system provides a streamlined, location-based attendance tracking solution for educational institutions, eliminating the need for manual attendance taking and reducing opportunities for proxy attendance.

## Core Technology

- QR code scanning for student identification
- GPS/location services for proximity validation
- Email automation for session notifications
- Report generation and export capabilities

## Key Benefits

- **Automated attendance tracking** - Reduces manual effort for lecturers

- **Audit trail** - Complete record of attendance with timestamps and locations
- **Flexible organization** - Supports programs with or without stream subdivisions
