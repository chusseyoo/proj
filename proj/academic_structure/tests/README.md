Test Structure for Academic Structure App

This test suite is organized by architectural layer:

- domain/ - Domain layer tests (entities, value objects, domain services, domain logic)
- infrastructure/ - Infrastructure layer tests (repositories, ORM models, external integrations)
- application/ - Application layer tests (use cases, handlers, DTOs, orchestration)
- integration/ - Integration tests (end-to-end flows, API tests, cross-layer tests)

Each layer package contains its own __init__.py and test modules specific to that layer.
