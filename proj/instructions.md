# QR Code–Based Attendance Management System (Django)

## 1. Project Overview
This Django system is built for attendance management where **students scan QR codes** to mark attendance.  
The system does **not generate QR codes**. Instead:

- Lecturers create attendance sessions.  
- The system emails students with a **link to the attendance page**.  
- Students open the page and **scan a QR code shown in class** (or provided by the lecturer).  
- Attendance is recorded automatically.

## 2. User Roles

### Admin
- Manages **lecturers, students, courses, and sessions**.  
- Can view reports and configure settings.  

### Lecturer
- Creates **sessions** under courses.  
- The system **emails students a session link**.  
- Displays a **QR code in class** (static/pre-made, not generated by system).  
- Reviews attendance reports.  

### Student
- **Does not login/register**.  
- Is registered by admin with **name, email, and course**.  
- Gets an **email with session link**.  
- Uses the link to open a scanner → scans the QR code in class → attendance recorded.  

---

## 3. Functional Requirements
1. **Authentication**
   - Only Admin & Lecturers log in.  
   - Students are email-registered only.  

2. **Student Management**
   - Admin registers students with email & course assignment.  

3. **Session Workflow**
   - Lecturer creates session under course.  
   - Students get email with session attendance page link.  
   - Attendance page includes **QR scanner** (using JS libraries like `html5-qrcode` or `Instascan`).  
   - Students scan the QR code displayed in class → attendance stored.  

4. **Attendance Recording**
   - Record includes student, session, timestamp.  
   - Prevent duplicate submissions.  

5. **Reporting**
   - Attendance records viewable/exportable by lecturer and admin.

## 4. Database Schema (Simplified)

### User (Admin/Lecturer)
- username, email, password, role  

### Student
- student_id, name, email, course (FK)  

### Course
- course_id, name, lecturer (FK)  

### Session
- session_id, course (FK), date_time, created_by  

### Attendance
- attendance_id, session (FK), student (FK), timestamp

## 5. Django App Structure (5 apps)
1. **accounts** → Authentication, user roles.  
2. **students** → Manage student records.  
3. **courses** → Course management.  
4. **sessions** → Session creation, student email sending.  
5. **attendance** → Attendance logging + reports.  

---

## 6. Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django 4/5  
- **Database**: SQLite (demo), PostgreSQL/MySQL (production)  
- **Frontend**: Django templates + Bootstrap/Tailwind  
- **QR Scanning**: `html5-qrcode` (recommended) or `Instascan.js`  
- **Email**: Django SMTP backend

## 7. Key Changes
- ❌ No QR code generation.  
- ✅ QR scanning only.  
- ✅ Attendance triggered on scanning a QR code displayed by lecturer.  
- ✅ Lecturer workflow simplified: session creation + email link sending.

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Mobile app integration.  
- Face recognition attendance.  
- SMS notifications.  
- Real-time admin dashboards.
